# Go Cookbook

Source for [the Go Cookbook](http://golangcookbook.com), a community build and contributed collection of practical recipes for real world Golang development.

### Contributing

The Go Cookbook is built by the community, so your contributions are very welcome.  Just send a pull request for any changes or additions.

#### Adding a New Recipe

Recipes are generated from the [_data/chapters.yml file](https://github.com/golangcookbook/golangcookbook.github.io/blob/master/_data/chapters.yml), which is used to build [the index page](https://github.com/golangcookbook/golangcookbook.github.io/blob/master/index.md).  The `chapters.yml` file is roughly like this:

```
- title: Strings
  recipes:
  - title: Concatenating Strings
    path: /chapters/strings/concatenation
    wip: true
  - title: Detecting a Substring
    path: /chapters/strings/detecting
  - title: Detecting All Substrings
    path: false
```

Specifying `wip: true` puts "[Work in progress]" in front of the recipe in the index.  Setting `path: false` causes the recipe to be listed without a link.

#### Recipe Format

Recipe files have a couple of required properties, which must be specified in the preamble like such:

``` yaml
---
title: Processing a String One Word or Character at a Time
question: Given a string, how do I break it into words or characters and process each one in turn?
---
```

Also, to show example code, recipes can make use of the `{% include example.html example="filename" %}` helper. This will include both `filename.go` as example source code, and `filename.expected.escaped` as the output of that code.  If you're curious, [that helper is defined here](https://github.com/golangcookbook/golangcookbook.github.io/blob/master/_includes/example.html).  The `filename.expected.escaped` files are automatically generated by the `./run_tests` script, described below.

### Run locally

```
$ bundle install
$ jekyll serve -B
$ open http://localhost:4000
```

### Run the tests

```
$ ./run_tests
```

...or...

```
$ ./run_tests chapters/strings/reverse/test_reverse_by_character.go
```

The `run_tests` script not only runs the tests, but also ensures that the `.expected`, `.go.escaped`, and `.expected.escaped` files are in place.  These files are then used in the recipe templates to ensure all examples are up to date and correct.
